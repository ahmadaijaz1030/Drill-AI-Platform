1. **Enhanced Tooltips**: Now show all drilling parameters including MINFINAL, UCS, FA, RAT, and ROP
2. **Extended Data Processing**: Server now processes and stores all additional drilling parameters
3. **Comprehensive Data Table**: Shows all parameters in an organized, scrollable format
4. **Sample Data**: Created sample CSV file with realistic drilling data for testing
5. **Well List Enhancement**: Updated well names and depths to match the image

## ðŸš€ How to Test

1. Start the application
2. Select a well from the Well List
3. Upload the `sample_well_data.csv` file
4. View the enhanced charts with detailed tooltips
5. Check the comprehensive data table
6. Test the AI chatbot functionality

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop (1024px+)
